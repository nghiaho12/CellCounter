INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================
CellCounter is a VERY domain specific cell counting tool aimed at assisting the
user count cells faster. For an example of the type of images the software expects,
please see my website (http://nghiaho.com) for some sample images. This program
was written primarily to help out a friend with their lab work. I don't plan to
extend this program beyond that. I'm releasing this software on the off chance
that someone else might find it useful.



USAGE
===============================================================================
The general work flow is

    1. Load an image
    2. Select a well
    3. Adjust the binary threshold
    4. Specify the range of colony sizes
    5. Click 'Count colonies'
    6. Click 'Save results'
    7. Repeat 1 until complete
    8. Copy text results into Excel for further processing

CellCounter makes a lot of use of the mouse and keyboard. These are

Mouse actions:
    Left button down + move - pan the image
    Left double click - centre the image
    Scroll wheel - zoom in/out
    Left click - select well
    Ctrl + left click - add colony
    Right click - remove colony

Keyboard actions:
    s - switch between binary and colour image

These instructions are also found in Help -> How to use
